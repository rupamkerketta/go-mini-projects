This repository was created for the sole purpose of learning `Go` by implementing the
various concepts in small and digestible projects.

_Good documentation, idiomatic code, and quick reference to small chunks of code samples_
were the motivating factors that led to the creation of this repository.

I mainly focus on building various `CLI` applications using `Go` in the mini-projects.
